#### Installation troubleshooting

##### missing extension 

Depending on your php installation, the `composer install` command can trigger an error message saying that some extension are missing.

If you are using php 7.2 on Ubuntu and the message say that mbstring is missing run the following command :  
`sudo apt-get install php7.2-mbstring`

Next continue from the step 2 of the install paragraph.

To install the application on php 7.2, run the following command  
`composer dump_autoload`

Next continue from the step 2 of the install paragraph.
